<h2>Car Insurance Login/ Policy</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

* Creating a simple web app with a login screen which takes username and password.

* Once authorised, it will navigate the user to another page which will display policy details.

* For reference, I have used the dummy two user data which will allow to login to this web app.

* User1: id="testuser", pw="EbpucVzUP5cvsYha0E9i"
* User2: id="jacob", pw="secretword"

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<h3>Installation</h3>

Please install the necessary packages and libraries using:-

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python3 app.py
```

In Flask, default port is ```5000```

Please once app starts running, please visit: ```http://localhost:5000/login```
or please click [here](http://localhost:5000/login).


<h3>Note</h3>
Due to the web app was minimal and light, as the Python Flask provides simplicity and flexibility, Flask was used.
In terms of the time, it took me around 18 - 20 hours to complete including planning.
